Hi there!\
This is MasterMind (a popular board game I guess)\
you can get instructions and more info from\
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game) \
I implemented it in c++ using sfml for graphics part.\
I know it could be implemented with ECS much better.\
for now I want to add a hint to game that can help player to have better guesses.\
I'll be honored to have your contribution.
